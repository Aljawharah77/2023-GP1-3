Project title: Mehrab
Mehrab is an android  mobile application that focuses on the improvement of mosque affairs management. It facilites 
the communication and manages the delegation of mosque door opening. The application intends to 
improve the user experience by enabling the mosque community to effectively communicate and 
receive persistent announcements. Moreover, the application offers the opportunity to participate in 
decision making with respect to daily religious activity whenever it is applicable. Mehrab aims to 
preserve data confidently and allow a single channel for both male and female users. In addition, it 
aims to enrich the role of mosques in religious education by offering the preaching lectures to a large 
community through announcing the activity to the entire Mehrab users. Mehrab intends to support mosque managers who aim to delegate some tasks in a trackable way. The door opening and closing will be controllable and trackable through tracking the time of opening and 
closing mosque doors. In addition, Mehrab will track the name of the delegator who opened the door. 
The delegated key can be revocable whenever needed. For this to be achieved IoT technology will be 
adopted and special smart locks will be used. The language used to develop Mehrab is Dart. There are 3 types of users which are prayers, mosque managers and admin. The admin is responsible for adding mosques to the system, in addition to creating the accounts for mosque managers and send them the credentials in order to use their accounts. Mosque managers will be resposible for announcing latest updates related to their mosque, open close mosque doors with the smart lock, delegate the smart key and track all delegation processes. Prayers can join mosque to recieve the latest updates and announcements, in addiotion to contacting the mosque managers.
